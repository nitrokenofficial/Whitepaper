Nitroken Whitepaper V1.0

ABSTRACT

NITROKEN is a blockchain-based structure that produces and develops solutions on DeFi and SocialFi. This Whitepaper includes the definition of NITROKEN and NITO Token, their purpose of use and the solutions they offer to the industry. NITROKEN aims to provide free, safe and fast experiences to its users by producing and developing blockchainbased decentralized projects.

1.	NITROKEN OVERVIEW
   
1.1.	What is NITROKEN?
Nitroken is an organization that aims to provide solutions to the problems of centralized structures by producing blockchain-based DEFI and SocialFi projects, and is on its way to becoming one of the leading structures in the sector with its decentralized applications. 
Blockchain was developed to make it impossible to change, hack or manipulate information in the system and to record the information. So, Nitroken aims to provide its users with a safe, fast, uncensored and decentralized experience with its projects. The cryptocurrency that will be used in its projects is NITO. Below is the description of NITO, the official cryptocurrency of the NITROKEN organization.

1.2.	What is NITO?
NITO is a cryptocurrency produced to be used in projects developed by the Nitroken Organization. NITO is a token. It is a token produced according to BEP20 standards on the Binance Smart Chain network. It will be used in various projects of Nitroken and its usage areas will be further expanded.

1.3.	NITROKEN VALUES
a.	Vision
Nitroken’s priority is to create commercial environments for our users that are safe, fast, transparent, borderless and do not require third parties. NITROKEN's vision is to create a completely free, transparent, secure and comprehensive financial system led by decentralization.

b.	Mission
Nitroken has examined in detail the problems created by centralized structures and aims to bring a new breath by examining the solutions provided by decentralized structures. Nitroken's mission is to provide and continuously improve unique decentralized structure solutions to its users. It continues to develop its projects with new and unique solution proposals by producing projects in the fields of DEFI and SocialFi. Various projects are being developed without slowing down, acting as a bridge between DEFI and SocialFi.

c.	Problem
In centralized systems, all information that is not verified by the centralized system is considered invalid. In a decentralized system, a horizontal decision-making mechanism comes into play instead of the top-down verification hierarchy applied in the centralized system. With a decentralized structure, an institution, authority, organization or person cannot have authority or control over the network and the transactions of individuals using the network. Since it is difficult to ensure security and control in centralized structures, vulnerabilities caused by being connected to certain components in centralized structures are reduced thanks to Blockchain technology in decentralized structures, and interruptions such as problems and system failures are eliminated.
Examining the advantages provided by Blockchain technology and decentralized structures, our team has begun to produce and develop solution suggestions by examining current problems. The NITROKEN team addressed the funding problem of cryptocurrency projects while designing its first project. When we examine the current problems, we see that there are some problems in centralized IDO platforms. Start-up projects that do not have sufficient resources must be able to access resources and at the same time, the rights of investors must be protected. It has been observed that centralized IDO platforms generally protect investors. As NITROKEN, it is explained in detail below that we have taken precautions to protect both investors and projects on our decentralized funding platform. These solutions and applications are described below, including their usage.

d.	Solutions
By creating decentralized projects, without depending on the decision mechanism of the authority in centralized structures, we promise to be safer against any attack or hacking, and faster against projects that are kept waiting for days. Thus, we developed our first project, NITROSTARTER, with Blockchain, one of the most popular technologies of the recent period. Cryptocurrency projects will be able to organize "Sale, Airdrop and Bounty" events on this platform. Users will be able to examine the projects, invest in the ones they want, and participate in the reward events of the ones they want. Airdrop and Bounty categories will become available in the next updates.
